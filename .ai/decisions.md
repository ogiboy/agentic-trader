# Decisions

## Decision Log

### The repository's own runtime remains the orchestration source of truth

Reason:
The project already has a specialist graph, manager layer, memory assembly, storage, replay, and operator surfaces.
Adding an external orchestrator as the central control plane would duplicate and distort existing architecture.

### External AI coding tools are development helpers, not runtime dependencies

Reason:
ChatGPT, Codex, and similar tools may help plan and implement changes, but they should not become assumptions inside the trading runtime.

### Provider expansion should happen through adapters

Reason:
The project currently assumes Ollama-class local models.
Future providers should be added behind a stable interface so agent workflow, memory, and runtime control surfaces remain consistent.

### Memory must remain inspectable and bounded

Reason:
Trading memory supports context, replay, and review.
It must not turn into a hidden policy mutation layer.

### Local-first remains the default posture

Reason:
The project's identity, safety model, and cost profile depend on local-first operation.
Future remote providers may be supported, but they should remain optional and explicit.

### CLI, monitor, and TUI should read from the same contracts

Reason:
Operator trust depends on consistent state across surfaces.
UI-specific hidden logic should be avoided.

### Operator chat memory must remain separate from trading memory

Reason:
Operator conversations are useful for coordination and explanation, but they must not silently mutate execution policy or contaminate trading-context retrieval.

### Hybrid retrieval should extend, not replace, existing inspectable memory

Reason:
The project benefits from richer similarity search, but retrieval must stay local-first, reviewable, and bounded rather than becoming opaque hidden behavior.

### Specialist disagreement should be persisted before manager synthesis

Reason:
When a manager overrides or moderates a plan, operator review should show not only the final decision but also the pre-manager alignment and disagreements that led to it.

### Memory writes must respect explicit domain policies

Reason:
Trading memory and operator chat memory serve different purposes and carry different risks.
Writes should be gated by explicit actor rules so conversational surfaces cannot silently mutate trade-memory retrieval.

### Terminal smoke QA should validate real operator entrypoints and quality gates

Reason:
The installed `agentic-trader` command, `python main.py`, Ink TUI, and Rich menu can drift independently from unit tests.
A small pexpect-based smoke harness should exercise the actual terminal surfaces, leave timestamped text artifacts, and fail loudly when the operator's PATH resolves a stale entrypoint.
Quality gates such as ruff, pytest, pyright, and SonarQube should be attached as optional QA checks without hardcoding tokens or changing the trading runtime.

### Localization should start as a shared text boundary, not a full i18n rewrite

Reason:
The CLI, Rich menu, Ink TUI, and future WebUI need consistent operator language, but the product flows are still moving.
A lightweight shared UI text catalog avoids duplicated labels today and creates a safe seam for future multi-language support without introducing translation machinery too early.
